# Product Requirements Document: Social Media Sentiment & Response Manager

## 1. Introduction

The Social Media Sentiment & Response Manager is an NLP-based application designed to monitor social media mentions of a brand, analyze the sentiment and intent of these mentions, and automate appropriate responses or escalations. The system will be built using a cloud-native, microservice-based architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and independent deployability of its components.

## 2. Goals

- To provide businesses with a real-time understanding of their brand perception on social media.
- To enable timely and appropriate responses to customer interactions on social media.
- To automate the handling of common queries and complaints, freeing up human agents for complex issues.
- To identify and alert businesses to emerging sentiment trends and potential crises.
- To showcase a robust, scalable, and maintainable system built on cloud-native and microservice principles.

## 3. Target Users

- Social Media Managers
- Marketing Teams
- Customer Support Teams
- Brand Managers

## 4. Product Features & Microservice Architecture

The application will be composed of the following five core microservices:

### 4.1. Mention Analyzer

- **Description:** This service is responsible for identifying mentions of a specific brand across social media platforms.
- **Functionality:**
    - Scrapes Twitter (and potentially other configured platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit) for brand mentions using keyword searches, hashtags, and @mentions.
    - Collects relevant metadata for each mention (e.g., user, timestamp, platform, original post content).
    - Filters out irrelevant mentions or spam.
    - Publishes new mentions to a message queue for consumption by other services.
- **Inputs:** Brand keywords, hashtags, platform configurations.
- **Outputs:** Stream of structured mention data.

### 4.2. Sentiment Classifier

- **Description:** This service analyzes the emotional tone and urgency of each identified mention.
- **Functionality:**
    - Consumes mention data from the Mention Analyzer.
    - Utilizes NLP models to classify sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
    - Determines the urgency of the mention (e.g., high, medium, low) using xlnet
- **Inputs:** Structured mention data.
- **Outputs:** Sentiment.

### 4.3. Intent Recognizer

- **Description:** This service classifies the intent behind each mention and determines the appropriate handling path.
- **Functionality:**
    - Consumes sentiment-enriched mention data.
    - Uses NLP models to classify mentions into categories:
        - Question
        - Complaint
        - Feedback
        - Other
    - For questions and complaints, further classifies them into:
        - **Type 1:** Suitable for an automated/bot response.
        - **Type 2:** Requires human intervention.
    - Enriches the mention data with intent classification and handling type.
    - Publishes enriched mention data to a message queue.
- **Inputs:** Sentiment-enriched mention data.
- **Outputs:** Mention data enriched with intent and handling type.

### 4.4. Response Generator

- **Description:** This service is responsible for generating and posting responses or escalating issues to human teams.
- **Functionality:**
    - Consumes intent-classified mention data.
    - **For Type 1 (Bot Response):**
        - Generates a contextually appropriate response using pre-defined templates or a generative AI model.
        - Posts the response to the respective social media platform via its API.
        - Logs the interaction.
    - **For Type 2 (Human Response):**
        - Routes the mention and all associated analysis (sentiment, intent) to a designated human support team dashboard or ticketing system.
        - Sends notifications/alerts to the relevant team.
    - **For Praise/Feedback:**
        - May generate an automated acknowledgment.
        - Logs the positive interaction for analytics.
- **Inputs:** Intent-classified mention data, response templates, generative AI model (optional), platform API credentials.
- **Outputs:** Posted social media responses, escalated tickets/notifications, interaction logs.

### 4.5. Analytics Engine

- **Description:** This service tracks sentiment trends, response effectiveness, and other key metrics over time.
- **Functionality:**
    - Consumes data from all other microservices (mentions, sentiment, intent, responses, escalations).
    - Stores and aggregates data in a suitable database.
    - Provides an API to visualize:
        - Sentiment trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
        - Volume of mentions by sentiment, intent.
        <!-- - Response times and resolution rates (for automated and human responses). -->
        - Identification of emerging issues or topics based on keyword frequency and sentiment shifts.
    - Allows for report generation.
- **Inputs:** Data streams from other microservices.
- **Outputs:** reports, data API.

### 4.6. User Interface
- **Description:** A web-based dashboard for users to monitor mentions, sentiment, and response effectiveness.
- **Functionality:**
    - Displays real-time data on mentions, sentiment, and response effectiveness.
    - Allows users to configure brand keywords, hashtags, and platform settings.
    - Provides a view of escalated mentions and their statuses.
    - Enables users to manually respond to mentions if needed.
    - Offers analytics reports and visualizations.
- **Inputs:** Analytics data, tickets from the Response Generator, user configurations.
- **Outputs:** User interface for monitoring and managing social media interactions.

## 5. Technical Considerations

- **Cloud-Native:** The application will be designed to run on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), leveraging services like containerization (Docker), serverless functions, managed databases, and message queues.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Each of the five components will be developed, deployed, and scaled independently as a microservice.
    - Services will communicate asynchronously via a message bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS/SNS) to ensure decoupling and resilience.
    - Each service will have its own database if necessary, following the database-per-service pattern.
    - APIs will be well-defined for inter-service communication where synchronous calls are unavoidable, and for external access (e.g., Analytics Engine).
- **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a varying load of social media mentions.
- **Resilience:** Failure in one microservice should not cascade and bring down the entire system.
- **Security:** Secure API keys, protect user data, and ensure secure communication between services.

## 6. Future Considerations (Optional)

- Support for more social media platforms.
- Advanced spam detection.
- Integration with CRM systems.
- More sophisticated response generation using advanced AI.
- Proactive engagement (e.g., identifying potential customers).
- Multi-language support.
